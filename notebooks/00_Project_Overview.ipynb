    "# Credit Risk Analysis with Alternative Data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project implements a comprehensive **credit risk modeling pipeline** that compares the predictive power of **traditional credit bureau data** versus **alternative data sources** for predicting loan defaults.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary research question is:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Can alternative data sources (digital footprints, behavioral signals, external scores) improve credit risk prediction, especially for \"thin-file\" customers who lack extensive credit history?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Findings Summary\n",

Conclusions\n\n## 9.1 Key Takeaways\n\n1. **Alternative data is valuable**: 47 alternative features outperform 334 traditional features (0.7177 vs 0.7029 avg AUC)\n\n2. **Combining data is best**: All features (381) yield the highest AUC (0.7742 with LightGBM)\n\n3. **LightGBM is the winner**: Best balance of speed, accuracy, and robustness across all feature sets\n\n4. **Thin-file customers benefit most**: Alternative data fills the information gap, achieving 89.4% acceptance rate\n\n5. **Simple models work well**: Logistic Regression achieves 0.7620 AUC with full interpretability\n\n## 9.2 Business Implications\n\n| Metric | Without Alternative Data | With Alternative Data |\n|--------|-------------------------|----------------------|\n| Best AUC | 0.7387 (LightGBM traditional) | 0.7742 (LightGBM all) |\n| Acceptance Rate | 77.7% | 84.0% |\n| Thin-File Acceptance | 86.5% | 89.4% |\n| Bad Rate | 5% (controlled) | 5% (controlled) |\n\n**Business Impact:**\n- **+6.3% more loan approvals** at the same risk level = increased revenue\n- **+2.9% more thin-file customers** included = financial inclusion\n- **+0.0355 AUC improvement** = better risk discrimination\n\n## 9.3 Model Recommendations by Use Case\n\n| Use Case | Recommended Model | Rationale |\n|----------|------------------|-----------|\n| **Production (Best Performance)** | LightGBM + All Features | Highest AUC (0.7742), fast inference |\n| **Regulatory/Explainability** | Logistic Regression + All | Strong AUC (0.7620), fully interpretable |\n| **Limited Data** | Extra Trees + Alternative | Best alternative-only AUC (0.7290) |\n| **Real-time Scoring** | Logistic Regression | Minimal latency, no ensemble overhead |\n| **Thin-File Focus** | LightGBM + All | Best thin-file acceptance (89.4%) |\n\n## 9.4 Future Improvements\n\n1. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Grid search / Bayesian optimization for all models\n2. **Feature Selection**: Reduce dimensionality while maintaining performance (SHAP values)\n3. **Ensemble Methods**: Combine top models (LightGBM + Logistic Regression + Gradient Boosting)\n4. **Time-Based Validation**: Use temporal splits for more realistic out-of-time evaluation\n5. **Fairness Analysis**: Ensure models don't discriminate against protected groups\n6. **Reject Inference**: Incorporate rejected applicants to reduce selection bias"
